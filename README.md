# CLINIC-BOOKING SYSTEM

The project is part of the Power Learn Project database module. It includes an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and SQL file to design and implement a database for a clinic-booking system.

## üìÑ Description

The Clinic Booking System is a relational database solution built in MySQL that manages the core operations of a small medical clinic. It helps organize and track:

Patient Records ‚Äì storing personal and contact information.

Doctor Profiles ‚Äì including specialties through a many-to-many relationship.

Appointments ‚Äì scheduling and linking patients with doctors.

Prescriptions ‚Äì generated for appointments, linked to multiple medications.

Medications ‚Äì tracked for dosage and frequency per prescription.

###### It supports various types of queries, such as:

Counting appointments per doctor or per day

Tracking the most frequently prescribed medications

Analyzing patient visit frequency

The system is designed with normalization and real-world constraints in mind (primary/foreign keys, NOT NULL, UNIQUE), making it a reliable backend for any clinical or health management application.

It models real-world clinic workflows, enabling insights like appointment statistics, prescription tracking, and doctor-patient interactions.
